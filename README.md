# odin-recipes
Welcome to COOK, my HTML project for The Odin Project Foundations Course. 
Here I will show my ability to use basic HTML elements and attributes to showcase tried and tested recipes in a visually pleasing and functional website.
Hope you like the site and get inspired to start cooking.
